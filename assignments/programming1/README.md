USE PYTHON3. This will NOT work with python2.

To run my classifier, use: python3 classifier.py


All of the report is in the report folder. All my VW work is in the vwtest
folder. Both my classifier and VW are set up to train on 80% of the data, and
test on the other 20%. All the data is scrambled.
